					<h2>Arts Research</h2>
				
					<p>
						On Wednesday Afternoon you will be hearing from members of the Modern Art Oxford team about their jobs <s>and what they entail</s> to enable you complete another section of your Arts Award. You will have the opportunity to ask them questions about the gallery and their roles within it.

						<li>Did you know all of these different roles existed? If not, which ones surprised you?</li>
						<li>Pick one person whose job particularly interested you. Describe what you found out about their career and job role.</li>
						<li>What different education and career paths to working in a gallery did you find out about? How did the Modern Art Oxford team get to work in their roles today?</li>
						<li>What was your question for the team? And how did they respond?</li>
						<li>Was there anything else you found out about careers in the arts today, or anything you found particularly interesting?</li>
						<li>Was there anything that you would like to know more about?</li>
						<li>How has this session influenced what you might do in the future?</li>

							 Arts Award Questions in Plain Text:
						</b></p>
					<ol>
						<br>
						<b>Pt. I</b>
						<li>What sort of art forms are you most interested in? (E.g. film, music, painting, performance...</li>
						<li>Can you give some examples of roles or careers that are involved in these art forms? (Think actor, director, musician, choreographer, writer, painter etc.)</li>
						<li>Where might these people work/exhibit? (For example: artists may exhibit in a gallery, or they may perform in a pop-up exhibition in a shop front.)</li><br>
					</ol>
					<ol><br><b>Pt. II</b> 
						<br><br>
						Now it’s time to find out some more about these art forms, artists or organisations. You may want to ask your art teacher or a local artist about how they got into art (via email or in person/zoom) or you may want to research more about how to get into the arts yourself - possibly the Oxford Brookes Art and Design Foundation course, for example. 
						<br><br>
						<li>What or who have you chosen to research?</li>
						<li>What sort of research have you done and where have you got your information? (E.g. Interview with "X" or online research using the "X" website)</li>
						<li>What have you found out about your chosen artist, arts organisation or future education or career pathway? (Give at least 5 key points.)</li>
						<li>Has this research influenced your future plans?</li>&nbsp; Yes / No / Maybe
						<li>State your reason/s to your previous answer.</li>
