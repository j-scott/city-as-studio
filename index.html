		<h2>Your Brief:</h2> 
			<p id="paragraphs">Welcome to the City as Studio online residency. As a City as Studio young artist, you have been commissioned by Modern Art Oxford to collaboratively produce a short art film in response to the life and professional practice of American artist and educator, Ruth Asawa (born 1926 â€“ died 2013).</p>

			<p id="paragraphs">During the residency you will take part in a series of Zoom sessions with professional artists in Oxford and complete the online, digital workshops that will guide you through the process of experimenting with film.</p>

			<p id="paragraphs">These creative activities will help you to explore new ideas to create original, impactful work. You will be encouraged to consider the world around you, the current political concerns impacting you today, and the vital role creativity plays in society. Take your time, be playful and question yourself and your creative approaches.</p>


><br>>

	<p>
		<h3>By the end of this City as Studio residency you will have produced a series of film experiments, and will be able to answer these questions: </h3>
		<br>
		<ul id="bulletpoints">
			<li>How professional artists make creative, unique films?</li> 
			<li>What artistic and technical skills go into filmmaking?</li> 
			<li>How do art films develop from a creative idea to being shown to public audiences?</li> 
		</ul>
